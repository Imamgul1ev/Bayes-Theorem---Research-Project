\maketitle


\section{Introduction}
Bayesian statistics is a powerful tool for analyzing and forecasting food prices, combining prior knowledge with current data to predict future trends and support informed decision making. Bayesian methods offer several benefits, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adapting to evolving market conditions
    \item Supporting data-driven decisions for pricing strategies
    \item Incorporating expert judgment and market insights
\end{itemize}

Real-world examples, such as forecasting food price inflation in dairy products or predicting price volatility in eggs, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in the food industry. The availability of resources like historical food price data and market reports makes Bayesian methods accessible to analysts and decision-makers. Despite some challenges, Bayesian statistics remains a valuable tool for understanding food price trends, guiding market strategies, and optimizing resource allocation.

\section{Bayes’ Theorem Framework}

\section*{Bayes’ Theorem Framework}

The Bayes’ Theorem can be used to calculate the probability of food price increases given an economic shock. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\(P(\text{Increase}) = x\)}  
    There is an \(x\)\% chance of increases in food prices in a given year based on historical trends.
    
    \item \textbf{\(P(\text{Economic Shock | Increase}) = y\)}  
    When food prices increase, there is a \(y\)\% chance that the increase coincided with an economic shock.
    
    \item \textbf{\(P(\text{Economic Shock | No Increase}) = z\)}  
    When food prices do not increase, there is a \(z\)\% chance of an economic shock.
    
    \item \textbf{\(P(\text{No Increase}) = 1 - P(\text{Increase})\)}  
    The probability of no price increase.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Calculating \(P(\text{Economic Shock})\)}

Using the law of total probability:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{Economic Shock}) = & \; P(\text{Economic Shock | Increase}) \cdot P(\text{Increase}) \\
& + P(\text{Economic Shock | No Increase}) \cdot P(\text{No Increase})
\end{align*}

\section*{Calculating \(P(\text{Increase | Economic Shock})\)}

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{Increase | Economic Shock}) = 
\frac{P(\text{Economic Shock | Increase}) \cdot P(\text{Increase})}{P(\text{Economic Shock})}
\end{align*}

\section*{Key Observations}

1. The numerator in Bayes' Theorem, \(P(\text{Economic Shock | Increase}) \cdot P(\text{Increase})\), represents the joint probability of an economic shock occurring alongside food price increases.
2. The denominator, \(P(\text{Economic Shock})\), ensures that the probability is normalized over all possible scenarios involving economic shocks.


\section{Summary of Research and Case Study}

This research utilizes Bayesian analysis to assess probabilities of significant food price changes across various categories based on historical data and recent trends. Key insights include the likelihood of high inflation in dairy products (40\%) due to significant month-to-month variation, and extreme price variability in eggs in 2025 (48\%) given their historical volatility. Similarly, the stabilization probability for meats, poultry, and fish prices in 2024 (35\%) is influenced by current negative monthly trends. Additionally, there’s a 20\% chance that fruits and vegetables will hit the lower bound of price predictions in 2025, reflecting the impact of historical stability and variability. Lastly, food away-from-home prices in 2024 show an 84\% likelihood of exceeding their historical average, driven by strong year-over-year growth.

This analysis demonstrates how Bayesian methods provide a structured framework for evaluating food price trends, offering valuable insights for stakeholders. By integrating historical data, current trends, and expert knowledge, these models enable more accurate forecasts and informed decision-making in volatile markets. This approach also facilitates effective communication of complex price dynamics to policymakers and businesses, enhancing their ability to adapt to market changes, allocate resources efficiently, and develop proactive strategies in response to evolving economic conditions.

\section{Application: Food Price Outlook}
\subsection*{1. Probability of High Inflation in Dairy Products}
\textbf{Goal:} Probability of high inflation in "Dairy Products" given its year-over-year change is significant. \\
\textbf{Event A:} High inflation (e.g., defined as an annual percent change exceeding $10\%$). \\
\textbf{Event B:} The category has significant month-to-month variation (e.g., change $\geq 0.5\%$).

        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{High Inflation Probability for Dairy Products Over Time}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Given Data:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Current year-over-year change: \(1.3\%\)
    \item Month-to-month change: \(0.8\%\)
    \item Historical average: \(4.0\%\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assumptions:}
\[
P(A) = 0.2 \quad \text{(Historical likelihood of high inflation for dairy).}
\]
\[
P(B|A) = 0.6 \quad \text{(Chance of significant monthly change given high inflation).}
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.3 \quad \text{(Overall occurrence of significant monthly change).}
\]

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem Calculation:}
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = 0.4
\]

\textbf{Conclusion:} There’s a \(40\%\) chance of high inflation for dairy products, given the observed month-to-month change.

\subsection*{2. Likelihood of Extreme Price Variability in Eggs in 2025}
\textbf{Goal:} Likelihood that "Eggs" will exhibit extreme price variability in 2025, given their historical and recent fluctuations. \\
\textbf{Event A:} Eggs have a price change exceeding $20\%$ in 2025. \\
\textbf{Event B:} Eggs have consistently had above-average variability in the past.
\textbf{Given Data:}

]
\addplot[fill=blue, opacity=0.3] {48*(x/12)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction Interval Upper Bound (2025): \(29.9\%\)
    \item Historical volatility of eggs: Frequently \(\geq 20\%\) (\(30\%\) of the time).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assumptions:}
\[
P(A) = 0.3 \quad \text{(Historical likelihood of >20\% variability).}
\]
\[
P(B|A) = 0.8 \quad \text{(High volatility continues when variability exceeds 20\%).}
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.5 \quad \text{(Overall high variability).}
\]

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem Calculation:}
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = 0.48
\]

\textbf{Conclusion:} There’s a \(48\%\) likelihood that eggs will exhibit extreme price variability (\(>20\%\)) in 2025.

\[
P(B|A) = 0.7 \quad \text{(Negative monthly trends leading to stabilization).}
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.4 \quad \text{(Overall negative trends).}
\]

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem Calculation:}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assumptions:}
\[
P(A) = 0.1 \quad \text{(Low historical likelihood of such reductions).}
\]
\[
P(B|A) = 0.5 \quad \text{(Minimal variability with lower-bound trends).}
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.25 \quad \text{(Low overall variability).}
\]

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem Calculation:}
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = 0.2
\]

\textbf{Given Data:}
\begin{itemize}

\]
\[
P(B) = 0.5 \quad \text{(Overall occurrence of year-over-year change >3\%).}
\]

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem Calculation:}
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.6}{0.5} = 0.84
