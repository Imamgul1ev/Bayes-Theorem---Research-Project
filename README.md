# Bayesian Food Price Forecasting

This project applies Bayesian statistics to analyze and forecast food price trends, offering a framework to combine prior knowledge and current data in making predictions. The primary objective is to understand how different economic shocks and historical patterns influence food price fluctuations, providing stakeholders with tools for better decision-making in the food industry.

## Purpose

The goal of this research is to demonstrate how Bayesian methods can be applied to predict food prices across various categories such as dairy products, eggs, meats, poultry, and fruits and vegetables. By incorporating historical data, expert insights, and market trends, this project aims to provide actionable insights into the likelihood of price changes, inflation, and volatility.

Key objectives of the project include:

- **Adapting to Market Conditions**: Bayesian methods allow for continuous updates of price forecasts based on real-time data, making it easier to adjust predictions as market conditions evolve.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: The analysis helps stakeholders make more informed decisions by evaluating the probabilities of price increases or stabilization based on observed market trends.
- **Visualizing Complex Data**: The project uses various visualizations (such as probability graphs and trend analyses) to communicate complex price dynamics to stakeholders in a digestible format.
- **Leveraging Expert Knowledge**: Bayesian models enable the inclusion of expert opinions in scenarios where historical data might be sparse or unreliable, offering flexibility in volatile markets.

## Key Components

### Bayes' Theorem Framework

The core of this project lies in using Bayes' Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities based on observed trends and prior knowledge. The model assesses the likelihood of food price increases based on economic shocks, historical volatility, and market conditions. Key components of the analysis include:

1. **Probability of Price Increases**: Estimating the likelihood of significant price increases in various food categories.
2. **Economic Shocks**: Incorporating economic events (e.g., inflation, supply chain disruptions) to adjust price forecasts.
3. **Market Variability**: Analyzing historical volatility and month-to-month variations in prices to refine future predictions.

### Case Studies

The project includes several case studies on food categories such as:
- **Dairy Products**: Forecasting the probability of high inflation based on month-to-month changes.
- **Eggs**: Evaluating the likelihood of extreme price volatility in the coming years.
- **Meats, Poultry, and Fish**: Investigating the probability of price stabilization based on negative monthly trends.
- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Assessing the chance that prices will fall within the lower bound of predictions.
- **Food Away From Home**: Evaluating the likelihood of prices exceeding historical averages based on year-over-year growth.

### Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations created using LaTeX and `TikZ` (through `pgfplots` and `pgfplotstable` packages) to visually represent Bayesian probability distributions and food price trends over time.

## Setup

To compile the LaTeX document, ensure that you have the following dependencies:

- `pgfplots` (for creating plots)
- `pgfplotstable` (for table formatting)
- `tikz` (for custom graphical elements)
- `graphicx` (for images)
- `amsmath` and `amssymb` (for mathematical typesetting)
- `hyperref` (for clickable links)

### Steps to Compile:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bayesian-food-price-forecasting.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd bayesian-food-price-forecasting
    ```
3. Compile the LaTeX document using a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf, TeXShop) or via command line:
    ```bash
    pdflatex bayesian-food-price-analysis.tex
    ```
